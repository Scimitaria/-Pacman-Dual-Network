          In my evaluation function I have divided the final score of the state in two parts
           1. When the ghosts are scared identified scaredTimes>0.
           2. Normal ghosts.
        Common evaluation score between both parts is the sum of the score for current score the steps
          for which the ghosts are scared, the reciprocal of the sum of food distance and number of foods eaten

          In the first case, from the sum I subtract the distance of the ghosts from current state
          and the number of power pellets, as the ghosts are currently in scared state. So closer pacman is to ghost better score

          In the second case since the ghosts are not scared hence distance to ghosts and number of power pellets
          are added to the sum.
